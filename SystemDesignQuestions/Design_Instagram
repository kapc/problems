Design Instagram:

1. Requirements:
- User should be able to signup/register.
- Add/Remove friends
- Upload photos/videos
- Like, comment on videos.
- Search based on tags or friends.
# News feed of photos/videos.
# Follow/unfollow other friends.


2. Non-functional requirements:
- System should be highly available.
- Low latency as it will directly affect user experience.
- Eventual consistency should be OK as it is fine for users to not see few photos for sometime.
- Highly reliable, as it is ok to see stale info but data should never be lost.
- Read/write. Very read heavy as on an average lot of people will view content more than they upload.

3. Estimation:
# I was very off, started with 500 M users/ 50 M daily active users/ 5 photos 1 videos each day/ 1 photo 1MB and 1
# video 5 MB. Comes to 50TB for videos each day and 250TB of photos each day.
From educative.io
300 M total users
1 M active users
2 M photos every day, 23 new photos per seconds
Avg photo size 200 KB
Total space for 1 day of photos:
    2 * 10^6 * 200 * 10^3 => 400GB each day
    400 * 365 in 5 years => 800TB
